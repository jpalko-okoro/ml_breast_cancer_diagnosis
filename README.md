# Machine Learning for Breast Cancer Diagnosis
This is a repo containing code to analyze and predict breast cancer diagnosis results using patient characteristics as well as certain medical markers or information. 

The information used in machine learning training and testing was pulled from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium


The Risk Estimation Dataset used here can also be found at the following location: https://www.bcsc-research.org/data/rfdataset/dataset 

Most of the development is going to be done using Python in addition to a variety of libraries such as AutoGluon and/or Pytorch

Development has been done using an Anaconda envirnoment supporting these libraries so tool dependencies will not be part of the repo 


**TODO: Add list of tool dependencies needed when using the repo**

**TODO: Add link/documentation for how to get setup when using this repo**
